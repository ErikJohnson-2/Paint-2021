New features:

  * Opened new JavaFX application in NetBeans with JDK 1.8 

  * ScrollPane for image and Vbox for general layout

  * MenuBar with menu items for open file and exit

  * Listener for menu items
  
  * FileChooser for opening image; extension filter with "try catch" to prevent errors

  * New MenuBar class called MenuPain for encapsulation (and future inheritance?)
