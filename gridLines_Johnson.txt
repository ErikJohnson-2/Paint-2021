Feature- Grid Lines

Menu Option that toggles an overlay grid composed of thinly lined squares. 

The grid should be derived from the dimensions of the scrollpane window and not

the dimensions of the image. This means you can zoom in or out but the grid is not zoomed.

This could be implemented by drawing the lines on the preview canvas.

The feature should ideally also have some x & y axis labels/tickmarks.
