There were three major techincal debt cleanup operations on this sprint.

First, the files had to be restructured so that autosaves and icons had a dedicated folder.
The project files were getting overly cluttered, to the point that it was difficult to track autosaves.

Second, ToolBarPain needed to be adjusted to reduce the amount of clutter in the constructor.
This was achieved by moving setToolTips  and setIcons to their own methods in the class.

Third, there was a dangerous arrangement for file Save/Open event handlers.
These handlers were all performed functionality seperately, even though they shared
many identical behaviors. They were compiled into calls for a OpenAndSaveMethods class.
This will also reduce overhead for updating the file functionality for things like transparency.
